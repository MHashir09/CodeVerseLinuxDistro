# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Our only supported version is the current version that the bot/code is on; **all** other versions are currently unsupported!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You have discovered a SECURITY VULNERABILITY! OH NO! WHAT'S NEXT?!

Next up is you have to make a report in the security tab, so that the development team can investigate your report. Reports are acknowledged within 72 hours, and a fix is output within a week (7 days) after acknowledgment IF the security vulnerability is true!
We (TheCodeVerseHub) ask you to make sure to report true security vulnerabilities because they **NEED** to get fixed right away!

If we do confirm that you have found a genuine security vuln we do highly ask you to report it.
We (TheCodeVerseHub) thank you in advance for reporting ANY security vulnerabilities that you do find within our code before they can be exploited!
