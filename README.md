# CodeVerse Linux Distro

CodeVerse Linux is a **community-driven, Arch-based Linux distribution** developed under the CodeVerse Hub organization.

The goal of this project is to build a **minimal, fast, and developer-focused Linux distro** with first-class support for **Wayland compositors**, especially **Hyprland** and **Niri**.

This is not a personal distro. It is a **collaborative open-source project** where anyone from the community can contribute.

## Project Goals

- Arch Linux base (simple, rolling, upstream-focused)
- Wayland-first experience
- Official support for:
  - Hyprland
  - Niri
- Minimal defaults, no bloat
- Developer-friendly setup
- Clean configs and sensible defaults
- Easy to extend and customize
- Fully community maintained

Beginner and advanced users are both welcome.
